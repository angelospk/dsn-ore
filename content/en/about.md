### The Institution

The Youth Council of Orestiada is an institutional body for youth participation in public affairs. We operate under the auspices of the Municipality of Orestiada, but maintain the autonomy of our proposals and actions.

Our goal is not to be just "another association", but the link between the municipal authority and the youth.

### Our Goals

1.  **Activation:** To get young people off the couch.
2.  **Culture:** To bring fresh ideas to the city's events.
3.  **Solidarity:** To support vulnerable groups in our area.
4.  **Outreach:** To put Orestiada on the map of Youth Friendly cities.

### How can I participate?

Our meetings are open! You can come, listen and share your idea. You don't have to be an elected member to help with an activity.
